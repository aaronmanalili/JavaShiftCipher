The way the Shift Cipher works is as follows:

1. User enters in a random message (ie. Hello)
2. User then is asked to enter a number to shift the letters in the message, which is the shift key
3. The cipher takes the message and each letter will move to the amount of the shift key for the Encryption function.
4. In the Decryption function, the program takes the Encrypted message and shifts back onto the original message.
5. After entering a message and a shift key, the program will print out the original message before encryption, the encrypted message, and the decrypted message.
